## Overview

Through HR analysis using Power BI, we gained valuable insights into the organization's workforce dynamics. The analysis unveiled gender distribution patterns, showcasing departmental strengths and recruitment sources. Furthermore, performance metrics highlighted employee achievements and areas of improvement. Employee satisfaction levels were also assessed, offering a holistic view of organizational well-being. Overall, this comprehensive examination fosters informed decision-making and strategic HR management.

## Problem Statement
Understanding and analyzing the HR data is crucial to assess the organization's performance, make informed decisions, improve employee satisfaction, and optimize recruitment strategies.

## Project Objective
To analyze HR data meticulously, derive meaningful insights regarding employee demographics, performance, recruitment sources, and satisfaction levels, and present these findings in an interactive Power BI dashboard for strategic decision-making.

## Process
<code> <b>Data Cleaning and Transformation</b> </code>

The initial dataset, sourced from Kaggle was distributed across multiple sheets, underwent thorough cleaning. This involved handling null, duplicate, and noisy values to ensure data quality.

<code> <b>Data Modeling</b> </code>

Multiple data sheets were merged and processed using Power Query. This step aimed to maintain data integrity and accuracy, setting the foundation for subsequent analysis.

<code> <b>Multi-Parameter Analysis</b> </code>

Conducted in-depth analysis using multiple parameters such as gender, department, recruitment sources, performance levels, and satisfaction.

<code> <b>Interactive Dashboard</b> </code>

An interactive dashboard was developed, offering users the capability to filter and visualize data seamlessly. Slicers, charts, and graphs were incorporated to empower HR professionals and management with actionable insights for informed decision-making.

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard offers a visually appealing interface presenting key HR metrics through charts, graphs, and cards, enabling stakeholders to gain insights into headcount, gender distribution, departmental strengths, recruitment sources, performance metrics, and employee satisfaction.

## Key Findings

1. Active HR comprises 67%, while terminated HR accounts for 33%.

2. Gender distribution reveals 43% men and 57% women.

3. Marital status shows 44% single, 40% married, and 10% divorced.

4. Production Department dominates with 209 employees; IT/IS follows with 50.

5. Performance metrics indicate 78% fully meeting and 12% exceeding expectations.

6. Recruitment primarily sources from Indeed (87), LinkedIn (76), and Google Search (49).

7. Employee satisfaction metrics show 35% acceptable and 32% very high.

8. Total salary distribution amounts to 21.47 million.

9. Employee distribution by marital status reaffirms 44% single, 40% married, and 10% divorced.

## Suggestions

1. **Retention Strategies:** Address the 33% terminated HR rate by implementing retention programs to reduce turnover and enhance employee longevity.
  
2. **Recruitment Focus:** Optimize recruitment efforts by leveraging effective sources like Indeed and LinkedIn, which have proven to be most productive.
  
3. **Gender Inclusivity:** Recognize the predominant 57% female workforce by introducing gender-inclusive policies and programs to foster equality and inclusivity.
  
4. **Departmental Resources:** Allocate resources and training programs effectively, especially in the Production Department, to maintain its operational excellence.
  
5. **Performance Enhancement:** Build upon the 78% of employees meeting expectations by identifying areas of improvement and offering targeted training and development programs.
  
6. **Employee Satisfaction:** Address the 35% of employees reporting 'acceptable' satisfaction levels by conducting engagement surveys and implementing measures to boost morale and satisfaction.
  
7. **Salary Structure:** Review the 21.47 million salary distribution to ensure competitive compensation packages, aligning with industry standards and employee performance metrics.

By implementing these suggestions and acknowledging the diverse needs of employees, the organization can create a more inclusive and engaged workforce, leading to reduced attrition and increased overall productivity.
